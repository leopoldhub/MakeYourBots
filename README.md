# MakeYourBots
**MakeYourBots** is a bot to "control them all". 

âš If you found bugs/glitches, please report on my discord **patatoe02#1499**âš 

ðŸ“¢this bot will need **ADMINISTRATOR** permissions to work (creating channels, manage users, see all channels...ðŸ“¢

He allows the community to add **safely** their bots on your server by managing and restricting their possibilities and actions to their "private" allowed category.

Community bots cant see everyone, manage servers... They **cantt do anything outside their channels**.

To add a bot, the user make a request with the bot id, the staff accepts it (administrator permission required) and bot category and permissions are automatically created and managed.

Staff can see all channels and remove bots, ban all bots from a user and/or ban the user and all of his bots.

Users can join bot's channels with the command 

> +botinvite \<botid>

and leave them with the command

> +botleave \<botid>
